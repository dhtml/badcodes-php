Common Mistake #6: Ignoring Unicode/UTF-8 issues

Make sure your PHP code files are also UTF-8 encoded to avoid collisions when concatenating strings with hardcoded or configured string constants.


utf8_encode and utf8_decode are badly named functions which are very rarely what you want.

Let's look at the encodings you're using:

htmlspecialchars($string)

htmlspecialchars($string, ENT_QUOTES, "UTF-8")
Here, you are telling htmlspecialchars that your string is encoded as UTF-8. So far, so good.

$string = utf8_decode(...);
